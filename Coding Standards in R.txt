Coding Standards in R

Write code using a text editor and save as a text file

Indent your code - different blocks of code should be spaced to the right a little further.
That way you can see how the flow of the program goes.

Limit the width of your code (80 columns is not bad)

Limit the length of individual functions - limit it to one basic activity - read the data,
process it, fit model etc.
One page is nice.
You can see where you are when debugging
